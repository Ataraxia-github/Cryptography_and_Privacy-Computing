E-book materials on privacy computing（有关隐私计算的电子书资料）



**The warehouse contains some books and materials related to cryptography and privacy computing that I have come across since I started my graduate studies. Some were recommended by my advisor and others I found on my own. I have read more or less of each book. To be honest, I haven't fully understood them all, and it's undeniable that some parts of these English originals have been quite challenging for me to grasp. Perhaps in the future, I will find time to go back and read and understand them more thoroughly.**

仓库里存放的是我研究生入学以来接触的一些有关密码学和隐私计算的书籍资料，有些是导师推荐读的，有些是我自己找的，每本书我都多多少少读过。说来实在惭愧，我并没有百分百地理解它们，不可否认的是这些英文原著的部分内容对我来说实在是太难以学习了，也许在之后我会找时间回头好好阅读理解它们。
